# Machine Learning Model

- As the data is very unbalanced, we need an algorithm that is robust to outliers.
- To make the whole thing in real time, we need to give attention to reduce latency.
- **ISOLATION FOREST** is perfect for this scenario.
- We used **Bayesian optimization**, **Grid Search**, **Random Search** for hyperparameter tuning.
- **Random forest** and **k-means clustering** also performed well in this dataset.
